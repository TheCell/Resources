# What is Maskito?
**Maskito** is a collection of libraries, built with TypeScript. It helps you to create an input mask which ensures that users type values according to predefined format.

Core concepts of the libraries are simple but they provide flexible API to set any format you wish: numbers, phone, date, credit card number etc.

## Why Maskito?
- **Maskito** supports all userâ€™s interactions with text fields: basic typing and deleting via keyboard, pasting, dropping text inside with a pointer, browser autofill, predictive text from mobile native keyboard.
- **Maskito** is robust. The whole project is developed with `strict` TypeScript mode. Our code is covered by hundreds of [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) tests.
- Server Side Rendering and Shadow DOM support.
- You can use it with `HTMLInputElement` / `HTMLTextAreaElement` or even with `[contenteditable]` element.
- **Maskito** core is zero-dependency package. You can mask input in your vanilla JavaScript project. However, we have separate packages for [Angular](https://maskito.dev/frameworks/angular) , [React](https://maskito.dev/frameworks/react) and [Vue](https://maskito.dev/frameworks/vue) as well.
- **Maskito** includes optional framework-agnostic package with configurable ready-to-use masks.

No text field with invalid value! Use Maskito. **Mask it!** Learn more about the library in our [documentation](https://maskito.dev).

## Maintained
Maskito is a part of [Taiga UI](https://github.com/taiga-family/taiga-ui) libraries family which is backed and used by a large enterprise. This means you can rely on timely support and continuous development.
