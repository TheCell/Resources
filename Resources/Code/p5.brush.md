p5.brush.js is a versatile library for the p5.js ecosystem, tailored for artists, designers, and hobbyists who wish to explore natural textures in generative art. This library extends the drawing capabilities of p5.js by introducing a rich set of tools that allow for the creation of dynamic and customizable brushes, vector-fields, and fill modes.

With p5.brush.js, you can easily configure and manage intricate drawing systems, inject life into your sketches with organic movements, and apply complex vector fields to control the flow and form of strokes. The library is designed with texture quality in mind, and may only be suitable for high-resolution artworks, not real-time interactive pieces.

Whether you're looking to simulate natural media, create patterned backgrounds, or design intricate particle systems, p5.brush.js offers the functionalities to turn your vision into reality. The API is straightforward and modular, providing both high-level functions for quick setup and in-depth customization options for advanced users.
