![[HQ Realistic explosions.webp]]

Some of the explosions are completely 3D and some are made using 1 sprite. The effects are very simple to use, just take and drop prefabs into your game!

**PC/Consoles/Mobiles/Web/VR supported.**
Supports built-in render by default. **HDRP and URP are supported using** [**this**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/support-package-for-hovl-studio-assets-157764) **FREE package for Unity 2021 or below.** It becomes free after purchasing one of my assets.

**URP/HDRP is default from Unity 2022 or Unity 6+**. Shader Graph is required which is installed together with this asset. Can be changed to built-in render.
