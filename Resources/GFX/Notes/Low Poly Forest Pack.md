![[Low Poly Forest Pack.webp]]

Every tree you need to populate a massive forest! Each tree has a proper pivot point for perfect planting. Each has it's own capsule collider for the trunk and canopy for low overhead collision data. Assets use a simple vertex color mobile shader, no complex overhead of other tree shaders. Ideal for flight sims, RTS or MMO games.  
  
Each tree asset is 28 - 36 triangles in polygon count.  
  
Textures are 512px x 512px and use minimal draw calls.
