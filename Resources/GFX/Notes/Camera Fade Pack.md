![[Camera Fade Pack.webp]]

***** NOW SUPPORTS THE UNIVERSAL RENDER PIPELINE ***** (for Unity 6)

[**Full instructions can be found here!**](https://www.battenbergsoftware.com/unityassets/camerafadepack/instructions_v1_3_0.pdf)

**Camera Fade Pack** is a set of **125 full-screen camera shaders**, all of which support Shader Model 2.0, which provide a number of creative and professional ways of fading a screen in or out. A transition component complete with Unity Editor Extension is included meaning transitions can be set up in the Unity Editor and started with a single line of code at runtime. An example scene is included to illustrate how this works. The transition component allows up to three shaders to be merged together to create unique transitions.

**Package includes:**

- **125 shaders**, all of which support **Shader Model 2.0**.
- Support for the **Built-In Render Pipeline** and the **Universal Render Pipeline**.
- A **transition component** and Unity Editor Extension for easy configuration.
- An **example scene** illustrating how to use the shaders and transitions.
