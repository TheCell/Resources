The asset includes:
- Different complex effects (Magic arrows, shields, buff and debuff spells, hits, magic circles, projectiles, attack spells, lasers, track markers and more)
- A large number of unique textures
- Multipurpose custom shaders
- Scripts, one of which allows you to change the color of the effects, [so you can change the color in 1 click.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7eF_AprVEY)

Supports built-in render by default. **HDRP and URP are supported using** [**this**](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/support-package-for-hovl-studio-assets-157764) **FREE package for Unity 2021 or below.** It becomes free after purchasing one of my assets.

**URP/HDRP is default from Unity 2022 or Unity 6+**. Shader Graph is required which is installed together with this asset. Can be changed to built-in render. All effects work on all platforms. They can be easily re-sized and re-colored.

Promo media (videos, images) uses post process "Bloom" from the Volume component.
