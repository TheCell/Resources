With the exception of Stock Film based LUTs, **all color profiles were created from scratch** in order to provide new and unique color variations. From basic exposure and tint adjustments to elaborate film like grades usually associated with popular films and video-games, you'll find an extensive array of looks suitable for almost **any type of project**.

If you use Amplify Color, you can take advantage of the LUT Browser(optional) to **instantly pick and choose LUTs** in your project by simply right clicking on the preview thumbnail, you can also apply them directly to your scene by simply left clicking on the LUT preview image, be it with a default thumbnail or your active camera. The **browser will automatically scan your project for LUTs and add them to the library** with both the name and category extracted from the file path.
