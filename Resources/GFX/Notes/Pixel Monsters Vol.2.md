![[Pixel Monsters Vol.2.webp]]

A total of 20 hand made pixel art monsters fully animated.

**UPDATE: A version of the sprites with black outline has been included, which makes them more compatible with the style of Pixel Monsters Vol 1 or for those who simply prefer this style. The sprites remain exactly the same, only the black outline was added, and the sprites from the previous version are still included.**

The sprites were created with a base size of 32x32px for most creatures, but there is a wide variety of sizes depending on the creature or its animations.

These creatures have a wide variety of sizes and animations, making it possible to give them different uses, such as heroes, enemies or level bosses.

Some VFX sprites are also included, which enhance the impact of certain animations and attacks.

Watch the video to get a detailed view of each monster and their animations.
